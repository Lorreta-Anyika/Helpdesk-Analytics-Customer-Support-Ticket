This project analyzes over 8,000 customer support tickets from a multi-channel helpdesk system. The goal is to uncover actionable insights about support operations, customer experience, and product performanceâ€”helping businesses reduce ticket volume, improve satisfaction, and optimize support processes.

> ðŸ’¡ **Background**  
> Every support ticket is a record of a customerâ€™s request for helpâ€”be it a technical glitch, billing question, or product concern. By systematically analyzing these tickets, we can identify pain points, operational bottlenecks, and opportunities for business improvement.

---

## Key Questions Addressed

- What are the main pain points and recurring issues reported by customers?
- Which products or services generate the most support tickets?
- How do response and resolution times impact customer satisfaction?
- Which ticket channels are most used, and where are the bottlenecks?
- How do customer demographics (age, gender) relate to types of issues or satisfaction ratings?
- Which products are most associated with technical, billing, or refund issues?
- Are there patterns in issues related to specific product lines or recent purchases?

---

## Data Source

- **File:** `customer_support_tickets.csv`
- **Source:** Synthetic dataset inspired by real-world helpdesk platforms (Kaggle)
- **Records:** ~8,000 tickets
- **Columns:** Ticket status, priority, channel, type, subject, customer demographics, product, timestamps, satisfaction ratings

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preview, shape, and summary statistics
- Handling and interpreting missing values
- Univariate and bivariate analysis (status, priority, channel, demographics)
- Time-based analysis (monthly, weekly ticket trends)
- Visualization of ticket status, channel, and product popularity

### 2. Customer Experience Analysis
- Identifying main pain points and recurring issues
- Analyzing which products generate the most tickets
- Assessing impact of response/resolution times on satisfaction

### 3. Operational Analysis
- Channel usage and distribution
- Detecting process bottlenecks (response/resolution delays)
- Evaluating ticket priorities and their handling

### 4. Customer Segmentation
- Satisfaction ratings by gender and age
- Types of issues by demographic groups

### 5. Product Insights
- Products/brands most associated with technical, billing, or refund issues
- Issue trends by product line and recency of purchase
- Visualizing top brands/models for each issue type

---

## Key Metrics Calculated

- Ticket volume by status, channel, priority, and product
- First response and resolution delays (in hours)
- Average customer satisfaction by segment
- Ticket status by priority (to assess triage effectiveness)
- Issue counts by product, product line, and time period

---

## Key Findings

- **Sony, Microsoft, and LG** top the charts for billing and refund complaints.
- **Fitbit and GoPro** have the most technical issues.
- Most tickets come via **email**, but **social media users reach out sooner** after purchase.
- **Critical tickets arenâ€™t resolved faster** than low-priority onesâ€”triage process needs review.
- **Customer satisfaction** isnâ€™t strongly tied to response speed; quality of support matters more.
